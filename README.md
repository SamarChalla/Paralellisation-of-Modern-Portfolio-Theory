# Modern Portfolio Theory:
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk averse investors try and minimize risk or uncertainity in their portfolio by diversifying their risk.
### Examples: 
#### 1. Diversifying risk by expanding the portfolio to different asset types rather than investing just in stocks
#### 2. By Investing in their portfolio at a certain calculated ratio minimizing risk or maximizing returns (depends on the risk apetite of the investor)
Check out the report for more information on MPT and my results. Uploaded both Parallelised code and Normal code simulating MPT.
